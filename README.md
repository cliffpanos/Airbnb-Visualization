# Airbnb-Visualization
This information visualization model allows users to explore average listing prices in specific neighborhoods; filter locations by room type, average rating, and number of occupants; and directly compare neighborhoods. It also allows hosts to observe which listings are similar to theirs in their area by filtering using the aforementioned characteristics.
